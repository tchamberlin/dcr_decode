    "Great! So we have successfully created an array that is the same shape as the `DATA` column. However, there is a little more to the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "We said before that the shape of the `DATA` column is `(numIntegrations, numPorts, numPhases)`. But what is the nature of \"phase\"? Well, phase, as used here, is actually a _state_, and this state is really a representation of two other states: that of the calibration diode and that of the signal/reference beam selection. This is best explained with a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| `SIGREF` | `CAL` |      Phase key       | Phase index |\n",
    "|----------|-------|----------------------|-------------|\n",
    "|        0 |     0 | `Signal / No Cal`    |           0 |\n",
    "|        0 |     1 | `Signal / Cal`       |           1 |\n",
    "|        1 |     0 | `Reference / No Cal` |           2 |\n",
    "|        1 |     1 | `Reference / Cal`    |           3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when `SIGREF` is `0`, it means that the signal beam is selected. Otherewise, it means that the reference beam is selected. When `CAL` is `0` it means the calibration diode is off, otherwise it is on. So, how does that apply? Well, since `DATA`'s shape is based on phase, it means we must _know_ phase in order to do queries on it. This is best demonstrated via example."
